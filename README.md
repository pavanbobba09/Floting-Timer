# ðŸ”¥ CodeRacer Timer

A browser extension designed specifically for competitive coding challenges, interviews, and timed programming contests on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeChef, and other coding portals.

## Why I Built This

As a competitive programmer, I found myself constantly struggling with time management during coding challenges. Most coding platforms have built-in timers, but they're often hidden in a tab or not prominently displayed. This extension keeps the timer always visible, helping me pace myself and avoid last-minute rushes.

## Perfect For:

- **Competitive Programming Contests**: Keep track of remaining time while focusing on the problem
- **Coding Interviews**: Time your practice sessions to improve speed
- **Technical Assessments**: Stay on track during timed assessments
- **Algorithm Practice**: Challenge yourself to solve problems within time constraints
- **Hackathons**: Manage time effectively during time-boxed challenges

## Key Features

- **Always Visible**: Stays in the top-right corner across all tabs and coding platforms
- **Minute-Based Input**: Set your challenge time limit in minutes
- **Start/Stop Controls**: Pause when needed (for breaks or interruptions)
- **Motivational Messages**: Random encouraging messages appear in the final minutes
- **Focus-Enhancing Design**: Fire-themed UI creates a sense of urgency
- **Visual + Audio Alerts**: Clear notification when time's up

## Supported Platforms

Works seamlessly with all major coding challenge websites:
- LeetCode
- HackerRank
- CodeChef
- Codeforces
- TopCoder
- Project Euler
- AtCoder
- GeeksforGeeks
- Codewars
- Interview portals (like HackerRank for Jobs, CodeSignal)
- Any other browser-based coding environment

## Installation

### Chrome/Brave/Edge

1. Download this repository
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or equivalent in your browser)
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the downloaded folder
5. The timer will appear on all websites you visit

## How I Use It

1. Before starting a coding challenge, I set the timer to the challenge's time limit
2. The timer sits in the corner while I work through the problem
3. Motivational messages keep me focused as time winds down
4. The alarm notifies me when it's time to submit my solution

## Development Notes

I built this extension to solve my personal pain point during coding challenges. The key challenges were:
- Ensuring it works across different coding platforms
- Making it non-intrusive yet always visible
- Creating a design that creates urgency without causing anxiety
- Implementing browser compatibility

## Future Improvements

- Add preset times for common contest durations (30min, 1hr, etc.)
- Track and save your completion times
- Custom themes for different contest types
- Integration with contest APIs to auto-set timers
